- This version moves the robot's head in order to follow the nearest detected face by converting 
the position of the face to the degree to which the robot's head should rotate to.

- This code is intended for Logitech C920. After the field of view is changed it can be used with 
other cameras (HORIZONTAL_FIELD_OF_VIEW and VERTICAL_FIELD_OF_VIEW).

- Tested only with the webcam (640x480).
